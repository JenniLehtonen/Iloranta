# Iloranta

This is mobile application that was produced in school in a team of four people. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/JuliaIkaheimo/Iloranta).
The project was eight weeks long and it contained meetings with our client, planning, designing, programming and writing documentation.

## My responsibilities in the project
In this project I was responsible of designing and programming the navigation bar, arriving page and contact page. I also programmed the modals to the map page that show the information of the places in Iloranta. During the project I was also helping my team member to build the multi-language support.
